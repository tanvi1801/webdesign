                <h2>Tacos</h2>
                <p>
                    This is one of those rare recipes that comes together so quickly and somehow still rivals a restaurant-quality meal.
                     It is a recipe that, once you make it, you say: I will probably make these chicken tinga tacos every time I have friends over 
                     because it makes me look fancy with minimal effort. You also say: I need to memorize this recipe. 
                     You also say: How soon is too soon to make these again.
                    It is a miracle and a delight. A perfect taco unicorn.

                    All the good cookie eaters of the world!
                    We were made for such a time as this.
                    These cookies are soft, thick, bricks of chocolate chunks and buttery dough baked into a heavy,
                    milk-loving cookie that is my most favorite chocolate chip cookie of all time. ♡

                <p>
                    I have never loved a salad as much as I do in this moment – 
                    a salad whose flavor profile (chipotle meets roasted corn meets cilantro) is at absolute the center of my food happy place 
                    and whose entire texture and form just mimics a big ol’ plate of pasta. WHAAAT.
                     Now we’re talking, kids. THIS is my kind of salad.

                    and it finishes with a generous drizzling.of creamy coconut lime sauce that is so big and so flavorful that you cannot be unchanged by it.

                    You know I’m not always the biggest fan of chicken but THIS. This sauce-soaked, herb-loaded wonder is exactly the kind of chicken I like.

                        This. Sauce. I make it all the time. I use it in tons of recipes. I spoon-feed it to myself straight out of the blender.
